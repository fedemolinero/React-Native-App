# React-Native Beer E-Commerce

In this challenge, we aim to create a small part of a beer e-commerce React-Native app.

The goal is to build two simplified versions of the following pages:
-A PLP (Product Listing Page) displaying a list of products.
-A PDP (Product Details Page) displaying detailed information for each product, and allowing the user to see price and inventory (i.e., number of items in stock) for different size-variants of each product.

The visual specification for these pages is found in the following link:

## Technical requirements for the frontend

• The PLP should be the application's initial page.
• The PDP should check for updated stock and price information every 5 seconds.
• All error messages, that you think should be shown to the user, should be reported by an alert dialog.
• The CTAs that engage parts of the application that are not implemented in the challenge (e.g., the "Add to cart" CTA) should display an alert dialog with the relevant information to be submitted (if any).
• Most importantly, write the code in an elegant, simple, and modular way, organizing things similar to how you would do in a real application for a real client.

## Please make sure that you do the following

-Carefully follow all the specifications given above, and the visual specifications given in the Figma link. Note, however, that you do not have to use the exact same fonts as in the Figma, and any close enough font will do.
-Separate the frontend and backend code into two completely separate project folders, each with its own package.json file.
-Include a README.md file in each of the frontend and backend project folders, with clear and full instructions on how to install and run that part of the challenge.
-Any instructions, error-messages, comments, etc. should be written only in English.
